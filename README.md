# stonegame
recreated the good old stonegame to test few things for fun

You basically can't win, but don't worry about that. Maybe you can in the next version, when I implement a feature to change the size of the field or something ;)

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Demo

Read the instructions first, I did not spend enough time with the UX ;)

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
